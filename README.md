# VideoSeek üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

VideoSeek is an intelligent video search tool that allows users to find specific moments in YouTube videos by describing what they're looking for in natural language. Instead of manually scrubbing through videos, simply enter a text prompt and VideoSeek will take you to the relevant timestamp.
