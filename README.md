# VideoSeek 👁️‍🗨️

VideoSeek is an intelligent video search tool that allows users to find specific moments in YouTube videos by describing what they're looking for in natural language. Instead of manually scrubbing through videos, simply enter a text prompt and VideoSeek will take you to the relevant timestamp.

## Getting Started

It is currently hosted on streamlit, you can test it [here](https://videoseek.streamlit.app/).


## Features

- **YouTube Video Processing**: Automatically downloads and processes audio from YouTube videos
- **Natural Language Search**: Find specific moments using everyday language
- **Smart Text Matching**: Utilizes advanced AI models to understand context and find relevant segments
- **Instant Playback**: Automatically starts YouTube playback at the matched timestamp
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit-based web interface

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You'll need the following packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pillow whisper-openai yt-dlp torch sentence-transformers
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/videoseek.git
cd videoseek
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the web application:
```bash
streamlit run st.py
```

### Command line

You can also run VideoSeek from a terminal, without the web UI:

```bash
python cli.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9w3gtgvNSU" "embeddings"
```

```
Best match at 4:45  (score 0.657)
  "even more numbers which we call embeddings and now we have a sequence of embeddings ..."

```

Options: `--top N` to show more candidates, `--model base` for a bigger Whisper
model, `--cookies cookies.txt` / `--proxy URL` when running from a cloud IP that
YouTube blocks. See `python cli.py --help`.

> **Note:** since mid 2024 YouTube blocks downloads from cloud providers, so the
> hosted Streamlit app usually fails. Running locally works.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Paste a YouTube URL into the URL input field
3. Enter your search prompt describing what you want to find in the video
4. Click "Submit" and wait for VideoSeek to process your request
5. The video will automatically start playing at the most relevant timestamp

### Example

```plaintext
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example
Prompt: "machine learning"
```

## Technical Details

VideoSeek uses several powerful technologies:

- **Whisper**: OpenAI's speech recognition model for accurate transcription
- **Sentence Transformers**: For semantic text matching between prompts and transcripts
- **yt-dlp**: For reliable YouTube video downloading
- **Streamlit**: For the web interface

## Limitations

- Maximum video length: 30 minutes

## Privacy & Security

- Downloaded audio files are automatically deleted after processing
- No user data is stored
- All processing happens locally on the server
